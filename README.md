# Parentheses Checker
Hello!

Here is a small app where you can check if your string is balanced in terms of parentheses, square brackets, curly brackets and chevrons: (), [], {}, <>.

### 1) Launch the APItesting API

Run the api on localhost:3000 with the command npm start, or node server.js

### 2) Launch the application

Launch the app on a local host as well (I use the command npx http-server -o), and then open the index.html file.

### 3) CORS

If your Chrome browser blocks your app,  add the Moesif CORS extension. For that, go to the symbol that looks like a piece of a puzzle on the top right of your chrome browser, and look for the Moesif CORS extension.
Add it and turn it on when using this app. Turn it off afterwards, otherwise it might cause some inconvenience.

### 4) POSTMAN
